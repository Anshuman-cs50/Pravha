### 🧠 Smart Features

#### Location Intelligence
```python
# Automatically generates 20 environmental features based on coordinates
features = generate_location_features(latitude, longitude)

# Considers:
- Distance from urban centers (affects urbanization, infrastructure)
- Geographic position (affects monsoon patterns, drainage)
- Proximity to water bodies (affects flood risk)
- Regional characteristics (affects deforestation, land use)
```

#### Enhanced Uncertainty Calculation
```python
# Dynamic uncertainty based on feature variance
feature_variance = np.var(request.features)
uncertainty = min(0.15, base_uncertainty + (feature_variance / 1000))
```

#### Smart Alert Routing
- Location-specific alert messages
- Risk-based alert prioritization
- Multi-channel notification system
- Alert history and analytics
