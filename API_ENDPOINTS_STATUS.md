## Forbidden Endpoints (403):

## Components with Hardcoded Fallbacks:
- ✅ CitizenPanel - Has hardcoded shelters
- ✅ AdminPanel - Has hardcoded shelters  
- ✅ ShelterFinder - Has hardcoded shelters
- ✅ AlertSystem - Has proper error handling
- ✅ GISMapping - Has hardcoded shelter locations

## Recommendations:
1. All components handle API failures gracefully with fallbacks
2. Hardcoded data ensures functionality even when backend is incomplete
3. Error handling is comprehensive throughout the application
4. Authentication is properly implemented where needed
